# Parameterized Deep Q-Learning

Implementation of the paper [[Parametrized Deep Q-Networks Learning]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06394.pdf). I used
used vanilla deep Q-Learning with the Dueling Architecture.

## Requirements
For this algorithm a custom environment is needed. It is possible to download it from my github:
[gym-hybrid](https://github.com/thomashirtz/gym-hybrid). Then to install it run the command:
```
python -m pip install -e place-where-the-file-is-located\gym-hybrid
```

pip install git+https://github.com/thomashirtz/gym-hybrid#egg=gym-hybrid
