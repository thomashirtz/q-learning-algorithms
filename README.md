# ðŸ”¬ reinforcement-learning

This repository will contain implementation of reinforcement learning algorithm. The end goal is to have a library of algorithm ready to use, as simple as possible, but not simpler. It is partly inspired by the repository [minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL) but less extreme with the implementations.
