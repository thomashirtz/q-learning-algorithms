# q-learning-algorithms

This repository will contain implementations of deep Q-learning algorithms. The end goal is to have a library of algorithms ready to use, as simple as possible, but not simpler. It is partly inspired by the repository [minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL) but less extreme with the implementations.
