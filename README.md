# reinforcement_learning

This repo will share content, notes and material to learn reinforcement leanring. 
My first goal is to follow the DeepMind class, try to implement all the examples of the classes using Python and follow the core of the class as notes. Depeding on the progress, I may extend this to the Sutton Book. I will also share the material that helped me to understand when I had some issues as well as code for the different demonstration.
