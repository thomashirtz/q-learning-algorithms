# ðŸ”¬ reinforcement-learning

This repository will contain implementation of reinforcement learning algorithm. The end goal is to have a library of algorithm ready to use, as simple as possible, but not simpler. It is partly inspired by the repository [minimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL) but less extreme with the implementations.

## Recording the environment

Code to save a mp4 video of an agent:

```
env = gym.make(ENVIRONMENT)
env = gym.wrappers.Monitor(env, "./video", force=True)
state = env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
    action = agent.choose_action(state)
    state, _, _, _ = env.step(action)
```
